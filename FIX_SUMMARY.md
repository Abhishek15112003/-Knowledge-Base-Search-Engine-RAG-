# Fix Summary - Summary Question Issue

## Problem
When users asked questions like "what is it about?", the system was returning the entire raw content instead of a proper generated summary.

## Root Cause
1. Too many broad keywords were triggering summary detection for normal questions
2. Duplicate detection logic in validation section
3. Too aggressive token limits (1024) causing long raw content dumps
4. Overly complex prompts

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Keyword Detection
**Before:** 30+ keywords including "about", "explain", "content", "list", etc.
**After:** Only 12 specific phrases:
- "summary", "summarize", "overview"
- "what does this", "what is this", "what's this"
- "about this", "tell me about"
- "what are the main", "main topics", "key points"
- "entire document", "whole document"
- "what is it about", "what's it about", "document about"

### 2. Removed Duplicate Detection
- Removed redundant keyword detection in validation section
- Now detects once in prompt generation section
- Uses the same `is_summary_question` variable throughout

### 3. Reduced Token Limits
- **Summary questions:** 1024 → 512 tokens
- **Specific questions:** 256 tokens (unchanged)
- Prevents overly long responses

### 4. Simplified Summary Prompt
**Before:** 8 detailed rules with lengthy instructions
**After:** 4 concise rules focusing on:
1. Use only CONTEXT
2. Include main topics and key points
3. Keep organized and concise (3-5 paragraphs)
4. Citations optional

### 5. Adjusted Retrieval Parameters
- **Chunks:** 12 → 10 for summaries
- **Context budget:** 8000 → 7000 characters
- More balanced approach

## Result
✅ Summary questions now return proper AI-generated summaries (3-5 paragraphs)
✅ Specific questions still work with citations
✅ No more raw content dumps
✅ Faster, more focused responses

## Test Now
1. Upload a document
2. Ask: "What is this document about?"
3. Should get: Clean 3-5 paragraph summary
4. NOT: Raw content dump

## Specific Questions Still Work
- "What is the refund policy?" → Concise answer with [1], [2] citations
- "How do I reset my password?" → Short, specific answer with citations
