1. Open `tester.html` in your browser

2. Upload a PDF or TXT document#### Summary Questions

3. Test various question types:- "Provide a summary of the whole document"

   - **Document Content**: "What does this document contain?"- "What does this document contain?"

   - **Summaries**: "Provide a summary of the document"- "Give me an overview of the main topics"

   - **Specific Questions**: "What is the refund policy?"

   - **Main Topics**: "What are the key points?"#### Short/Fuzzy Queries

- "refund" â†’ Enhanced to "refund policy return"

#### API Testing- "pasword" â†’ Corrected to "password"

Use curl or any HTTP client to test the endpoints:- "hrs" â†’ Expanded to "hours business"



```bash##  Testing

# Upload a document

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/upload" -F "file=@your_document.pdf"### Testing the System



# Ask questions (use session_id from upload response)#### Web Interface Testing (Recommended)

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ask" \1. Open `tester.html` in your browser

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \2. Upload a PDF or TXT document

  -d '{"session_id":"your-session-id","q":"What does this document contain?","strict":true}'3. Test various question types:

```   - **Document Content**: "What does this document contain?"

   - **Summaries**: "Provide a summary of the document"

## Architecture   - **Specific Questions**: "What is the refund policy?"

   - **Main Topics**: "What are the key points?"

### RAG Pipeline

1. **Document Processing**: #### API Testing

   - PDF/TXT extraction using pypdfUse curl or any HTTP client to test the endpoints:

   - Text chunking with overlap for context preservation

   - TF-IDF vectorization with n-gram support (1-3 words)```bash

# Upload a document

2. **Query Processing**:curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/upload" -F "file=@your_document.pdf"

   - Fuzzy correction for typos using difflib

   - Synonym expansion for short queries# Ask questions (use session_id from upload response)

   - Dynamic parameter adjustment based on query lengthcurl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ask" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

3. **Retrieval & Generation**:  -d '{"session_id":"your-session-id","q":"What does this document contain?","strict":true}'

   - TF-IDF cosine similarity for relevant chunk retrieval```
