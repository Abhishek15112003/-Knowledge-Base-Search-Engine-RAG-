# Changes Made to Handle "What is it about" Type Queries

## Summary
Enhanced the RAG system to better handle broad overview and summary questions like "what is it about", "what does this document contain", "give me a summary", etc.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Expanded Summary Question Detection** (`backend/app.py`)
   - **Location**: `_gemini_answer()` function and `/ask` endpoint
   - **Change**: Added more keywords to detect summary/overview questions
   - **New Keywords Added**:
     - "what is this", "what is it", "what's this", "what's it"
     - "tell me", "give me overview", "give me summary", "give me details"
     - "what are", "list", "show me", "document about", "file about"
     - "purpose", "topic", "subject", "covers what", "discuss"
     - "entire document", "whole document", "full document"
     - "everything", "all information", "complete", "comprehensive"
   
   - **Impact**: System now recognizes more variations of summary questions

### 2. **Enhanced Prompt for Summary Questions** (`backend/app.py`)
   - **Location**: `_gemini_answer()` function
   - **Changes**:
     - Added explicit instruction to cover document's main purpose, subject matter, and key points
     - Made citations optional for broad overviews (Rule 5)
     - Added instruction to structure responses with clear sections or bullet points (Rule 8)
     - Increased clarity about organizing information logically
   
   - **Impact**: AI generates more comprehensive, well-structured summaries

### 3. **Increased Token Limit for Summaries** (`backend/app.py`)
   - **Location**: `_gemini_answer()` function
   - **Change**: Increased `max_output_tokens` from 768 to 1024 for summary questions
   - **Also**: Increased `temperature` from 0.1 to 0.2 for more natural summaries
   - **Impact**: Allows longer, more detailed summary responses

### 4. **More Lenient Validation for Summaries** (`backend/app.py`)
   - **Location**: `_gemini_answer()` function (strict validation section)
   - **Change**: 
     - Lowered overlap threshold from 35% to 30% for summaries
     - Removed requirement for citations in summary responses
     - Added comment explaining natural summaries don't need forced bracket citations
   
   - **Impact**: Summary answers are accepted even without strict citation format

### 5. **Intelligent Chunk Retrieval for Summaries** (`backend/app.py`)
   - **Location**: `/ask` endpoint
   - **Changes**:
     - Detect summary questions before retrieval
     - Automatically increase retrieved chunks from 6 to 12 for summary questions
     - Increase context budget from 6000 to 8000 characters for summaries
   
   - **Impact**: Summary questions get more comprehensive context from the document

### 6. **Improved User Interface** (`tester.html`)
   - **Location**: Question textarea placeholder
   - **Change**: Added helpful examples including:
     - "What is this document about?"
     - "Give me a summary of the document"
     - "What are the main topics?"
   
   - **Impact**: Users are guided to ask better questions

## How It Works Now

### For Questions Like "What is it about?":
1. **Detection**: System recognizes this as a summary question
2. **Retrieval**: Fetches up to 12 chunks (instead of 6) for comprehensive coverage
3. **Context Building**: Allocates 8000 characters (instead of 6000) for more content
4. **Prompt**: Uses specialized summary prompt with clear rules
5. **Generation**: AI generates up to 1024 tokens (instead of 256) for detailed response
6. **Validation**: More lenient - accepts natural summaries without forced citations

### For Specific Questions (e.g., "What is the refund policy?"):
1. **Detection**: Not recognized as summary question
2. **Retrieval**: Standard 6 chunks
3. **Context Building**: Standard 6000 characters
4. **Prompt**: Uses specific question prompt with strict citation requirements
5. **Generation**: AI generates up to 256 tokens for concise response
6. **Validation**: Strict - requires citations [1], [2] and good content overlap

## Testing Recommendations

Test with these example queries:
- ✅ "What is this document about?"
- ✅ "What does this document contain?"
- ✅ "Give me a summary"
- ✅ "What are the main topics?"
- ✅ "Tell me about this document"
- ✅ "What is it about?"
- ✅ "Describe the document"
- ✅ "What's the purpose of this?"

Compare with specific questions:
- ✅ "What is the refund policy?"
- ✅ "How do I reset my password?"
- ✅ "What are the business hours?"

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can ask natural overview questions
2. **More Comprehensive Summaries**: Longer, more detailed responses for broad questions
3. **Smart Resource Allocation**: More context for summaries, concise for specific questions
4. **Natural Language**: Summaries don't require awkward citation formatting
5. **Flexible**: System automatically adapts based on question type

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app.py` - Core logic changes
2. `tester.html` - UI improvements with better examples

## No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality remains intact. Specific questions still work exactly as before with strict grounding and citations.
